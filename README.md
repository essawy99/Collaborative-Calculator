This is a Calculator that can save calculations to a 
server. All users of the app can see the previous ten
calculations in the order that they were calculated.

Using the app is simple. Add numbers and operations as needed.
Use parentheses to break typical PEMDAS ordering, use '(-)' to add a negative sign, '.' to add a decimal point, and click the 'del' button to delete a character. Once you click '=', the calculator will evaluate the expression and display the equation on the right for all users. To clear the previous
calculations click the red clear button on the right. This will clear calculations for all users. 

If the app is not used for a while the server will shut down to save resources. However, all data is saved to a file system and is reloaded when the server is brought back up. Going on the website will automatically wake up the server.
